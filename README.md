# powerBi-first-dashboard
This repository showcases my first dashboard created in Power BI. The Data Professionals Survey Dashboard visualizes key metrics from a survey conducted among data professionals across various roles, including Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Analysts. Here’s a quick overview of what’s included:

Key Visuals
Average Salary by Job Title: A comparison of average salaries across data roles.
Work-Life Balance & Salary Satisfaction: Gauges reflecting the surveyed professionals’ satisfaction levels.
Country Demographics: Insights into the geographical distribution of survey participants.
Favorite Programming Languages: A breakdown of the most popular programming languages among data professionals.
Dashboard Highlights
User-Friendly Layout: Designed with a clean, accessible structure for easy navigation.
Insightful Visualizations: Each visual component provides meaningful insights into the data professional community.
Gender & Role Comparisons: Insight into the demographics, work-life balance, and satisfaction levels by gender and job role.
This project marks my first venture into Power BI, and I’m looking forward to feedback and suggestions for improvement! Feel free to explore the code and dashboard, and let me know your thoughts.
